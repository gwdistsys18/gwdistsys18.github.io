In this homework you will build the simplest type of distributed system---a client/server application. For simplicity we will run both the client and the server on the same computer: a "container" running on the CodeAnywhere web site.

  1. [Setup accounts for Git and CodeAnywhere](/accounts/) - follow all steps carefully!
  2. [Create your version of the homework git repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/Rf9JsXvi)
  3. Go to the repository created in step 2 and look at the README.md file. This has all the instructions for the assignment.

You must complete and submit the assignment by pushing all of your final code to GitHub by *Friday September 7th at 10AM* (note this is AM, not PM).  Check your files through the GitHub web interface to ensure that they were all uploaded correctly!

**Note:** For this assignment you *must* complete your work in the CodeAnywhere environment.

You will see that I am not teaching you many of the basics needed to solve the assignment. You must figure these things out.

For this assignment I will allow you to work in small groups of up to 3 students, but you still must write and submit all of your own code. This means that you may *NOT* divide up the assignment and have one student write the C code and another student write the Java code -- you each must write all of your own code, but you can discuss your problems with another student as you do so.  If I find that multiple students are submitting identical solutions, that will count as cheating and you will *fail the assignment!*
