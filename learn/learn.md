To really understand cloud computing you need hands-on practice using cloud services. You will be able to pick from several different topic areas to decide what you want to learn about.

  - [Docker and Containers](/learn/docker/)
  - [Big Data and Machine Learning](/learn/bigdata/)
  - [Cloud Web Applications](/learn/web/)
  - [SDN and NFV](/learn/sdnfv/)

In each topic you have the choice of attaining *Beginner* or *Intermediate* level mastery.
 - By **Monday October 29th** you must attain Beginner/Intermediate level in a first topic and Beginner level in a second topic
 - Achieving Beginner level mastery should take 1-2 hours per area, while Intermediate level is likely to take 10+ hours.

For each topic area you will need to do the following:
  - Create a [fork of this Git repository](https://github.com/gwdistsys18/dist-sys-practice) to record your progress and notes as you go through the linked materials
  - For each video/lab/tutorial, you must make a short writeup (bullet points or a paragraph) that highlights the key things you learned from the material and add it to your repository
  - Record how much time you spend on each lab or tutorial
  - Each topic ends with a small project to bring together all of the ideas you've learned so far. You must provide a complete writeup about your project that explains what technologies you used and how they interact for the project. This should be written in the form of a blog post which a typical computer scientist should be able to read and learn from.

Your notes should be written in a way that both helps you remember what you learned, but also would help a new student to figure out the key points of each tutorial/video. Part of your grade will be based on how complete and nicely formatted your notes are. You should keep all of your documentation in Markdown syntax so they can be viewed through the github web interface, or (even better) you can use GitHub pages to turn those markdown files into a nice looking web page.

Your fork of the repository will be public in your own GitHub account, so it is in your interest to make it look good!
