To really understand cloud computing you need hands-on practice using cloud services. You will be able to pick from several different topic areas to decide what you want to learn about.

  - [Docker and Containers](/learn/docker/)
  - [Big Data and Machine Learning](/learn/bigdata/)
  - [Cloud Web Applications](/learn/web/)

In each topic you have the choice of attaining *Beginner* or *Intermediate* level mastery.
 - By **Sunday October 29th** you must attain Beginner level in at least two topics and Intermediate level in one topic
 - Achieving Beginner level mastery should take 1-2 hours per area, while Intermediate level is likely to take 10+ hours.

For each topic area you will need to do the following:
  - Maintain a Git repository that records your progress and notes as you go through the linked materials
  - For each video/lab/tutorial, you must make a short writeup (bullet points or a paragraph) that highlights the key things you learned from the material
  - Record how much time you spend on each lab or tutorial
  - Each topic ends with a small project to bring together all of the ideas you've learned so far. You must provide a complete writeup about your project that explains what technologies you used and how they interact for the project. This should be written in the form of a blog post which a typical computer scientist should be able to read and learn from.
