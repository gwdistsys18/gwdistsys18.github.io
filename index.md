> This course will be an in-depth study of the algorithmic and implementation challenges in building large scale distributed applications. Topics include distributed coordination, scheduling, consistency issues, and fault tolerance algorithms. The course will cover how fundamental distributed systems concepts are applied to cloud computing environments. The course will mix algorithmic concepts and practical implementations built using Amazon's cloud services; substantial programming experience is required.
>
> Prerequisites: CSCI 6212 Design and Analysis of Algorithms, CSCI 3411 undergraduate Operating Systems.
